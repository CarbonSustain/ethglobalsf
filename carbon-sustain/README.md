1. To run the code, use npm start, but to send transactions and receive messages, you need to first execute node src/index.js from the broadcast-bot directory.

2. The current code contains:
const cstTokenAddress = '0xEC3De877136145D53172f0a8A6E40cc2eA142104'; // CST token contract address
const recipientAddress = '0x218E85782dcD225c6646Df190dAF627c21374BA7'; // Test recipient address
The cstTokenAddress refers to the actual CST token contract that was deployed, and the recipientAddress is a test account. However, if you implement login using Alchemy, the address obtained from the logged-in account should be used as the recipientAddress.

3. The transaction is handled via MetaMask, as implementing the function with WalletConnect has proven difficult, so only MetaMask is being used for now.

4. The rest of the files are unchanged from the initial React project setup, so there’s no need to modify them unless a front-end is being developed.

TODO:
1. We still haven’t implemented the functionality to purchase tokens in a 50:50 blend of two coins, so that needs to be done.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
